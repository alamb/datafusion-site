I think DataFusion is reaching an inflection point: It is now good enough that
more than early adopters can and are building real, production systems using
DataFusion. This is a great milestone ðŸŽ‰ and I think the project is adjusting to
this new reality.

One major theme we have been discussing in the last week or two is making
upgrades easier. The recent pushes in 43.0.0 and 44.0.0 to clean up / complete
projects such as StringView, window function migration, improved APIs, etc have
caused significant downstream complications upgrading. Going forward as a
community, we are discussing ways to improve this process.


Another major theme is iceberg and other table formats and I think 2025 we will continue to see many new systems built around open data lakes (TODO Juliens blog post).
TODO link to ticket about making it easier to use table formats / run against datafusion on table formats.

TODO image with open data lake, etc with constellation of engines around it
